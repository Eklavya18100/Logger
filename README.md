# Logger

I have used asyncio to create the asynchronous logger and used buffer to queue the log messages therefore, making it fast. It enables asynchronous logging functionality in asyncio-based applications. It provides a LogComponent class that allows you to write log messages concurrently without blocking the main execution thread.


Usage:
run the main.py using the following command:

python main.py
